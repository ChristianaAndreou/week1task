## 1. Introduction to the Project
👋 **Hotel Reviews Analytics**  
 
**Analyzing Hotel Reviews with Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modeling**

Project Overview:
This project builds upon work I completed during my PhD, where I gathered and analyzed 16,813 reviews from 42 hotels located in Italy, Austria, Spain, and Denmark. The dataset includes reviews across a variety of categories such as cleanliness, location, staff, comfort, breakfast, and more.
The main goal was to apply Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling to derive insights into customer experiences and the performance of the hotels.
